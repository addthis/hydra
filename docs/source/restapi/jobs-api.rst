Jobs API

``/job/list``
====================
Verb: GET

Returns the entire list of jobs in the form of a json array.


``/job/enable``
====================
Verb: GET

Enable or disable a list of jobs.

QueryParam:
 * jobs: The jobs that need to be enabled. Specified as a comma separated list of job IDs.
 * enable: Enable or disable? Specified as 1 for enable, and 0 for disable. Default: 1.

``/job/rebalance``
====================
Verb: GET

Rebalance a job.

QueryParam:
 * id: The jobs that need to be rebalanced. Specified as a comma separated list of job IDs.

``/job/expand``
====================
Verb: GET

Return the expanded configuration of a specified job (without macros or parameters declarations);

QueryParam:
 * id: The id of the job to expand.

``/job/validate``
====================
Verb: GET

Validates the configuration of a specified job;

QueryParam:
 * id: The id of the job to validate.

``/job/delete``
====================
Verb: GET

Delete a specific job.

QueryParam:
 * id: The job id of the job to be deleted.

Job Dependencies
================

Job dependencies are represented as a directed graph. An edge from job A to job B represents
a data dependency from job A to job B. It is easiest to understand the directed graph
as a representation of the flow of data across the jobs. Data flows along the direction
of the edge. To illustrate the four API endpoints let's use the following job dependency
graph as an example:

``/job/dependencies/sources``
=============================
Verb: GET

Returns a dependency graph of the transitive upstream jobs of the target.

QueryParam:
 * id: The job id of the target job.

.. figure:: /_static/dependencies/sources.png
    :height: 150px
    :align: center

    The sources of job E

``/job/dependencies/sinks``
===========================
Verb: GET

Returns a dependency graph of the transitive downstream jobs of the target.

QueryParam:
 * id: The job id of the target job.

.. figure:: /_static/dependencies/sinks.png
    :height: 150px
    :align: center

    The sinks of job E

``/job/dependencies/connected``
===============================
Verb: GET

Returns a dependency graph of the transitive closure of all connected jobs to the target.

QueryParam:
 * id: The job id of the target job.

    :height: 200px
    :align: center

    All jobs connected to job E

``/job/dependencies/all``
=========================

 * id: The job id of the job. Required.
 * task: The task number of the task to be stopped. Default to -1 which means all tasks.

``/job/start``
====================
Verb: GET

Sends a kick signal to a job.

QueryParam:
 * id: The job id of the job. Required.

# This file is included in reference.conf at the path com.addthis.job.spawn.Spawn (or similar). This gives all
# of these settings the effective path of com.addthis.job.spawn.Spawn.dataDir and so on. Accordingly, they may
# be overridden via system properties; eg. `-Dcom.addthis.job.spawn.Spawn.queryPort=123`. (this functionality
# is provided by typesafe-config; see their docs for more details).

# A common idiom here (and elsewhere) is to support optional overrides from legacy system properties. This looks
# like `webPort = ${?spawn.http.port}`. They have no effect if the legacy system property is not set at runtime.

# If neither the fully qualified class path, nor the legacy alias (if any) is set, then the default will be used.
# These are the settings that look like `queueType = rabbit`. One of the three values will then be available at
# runtime via eg. `ConfigFactory.load().atPath("com.addthis.job.spawn.Spawn.queryPort");` The value is always
# available from the fully qualified class path. If a legacy alias or default is used, it is just copied to that
# location.

# Configurations on that path are queried by codec when constructing Spawn objects (and from corresponding fully
# qualified paths for objects of other types). Codec considers these the "global defaults" for those fields, and
# in Spawn's case, we generally just call `Configs.newDefault(Spawn.class)`, which attempts to use only "global
# defaults". This is a common idiom for singleton classes without any sub-classes.

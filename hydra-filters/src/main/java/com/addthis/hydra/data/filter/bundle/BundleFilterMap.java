/**
 * This {@link BundleFilter BundleFilter} <span class="hydra-summary">executes a sequence of {@link BundleFilterField BundleFilterField} operations</span>.
 * <p/>
 * <p>A BundleFilterField runs a value filter on a specific field.
 * The value filter is run on the value stored at the location of the {@link BundleFilterField#from from}
 * field. If the {@link BundleFilterField#to to} field is specified then the output
 * of the filter operation is stored in that field. Otherwise the
 * from field is updated with the output of the filter operation.
 * If the value filter is not specified then the value is copied
 * with no filtering.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   {op:"map", fields:[
 *        {from: "DATE", to: "DATE_YMD", filter: {op: "slice", to: 6}},
 *        {from: "DATE", to: "DATE_HOUR", filter: {op: "slice", from: 7, to: 9}},
 *   ]},
